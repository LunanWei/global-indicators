# Global Healthy and Sustainable Cities Indicators Collaboration spatial urban indicators framework (global-indicators)

An open-source tool for calculating spatial indicators for healthy, sustainable cities worldwide using open or custom data.

This software framework provides a generalized method to measure spatial urban indicators for within- and between-city comparisons with outputs as spatial point data as well as high resolution small area and overall city summaries. The methodology and the open data approach developed in this research can be expanded to many cities worldwide to support benchmarking, analysis and monitoring of local policies, track progress, and inform interventions towards achieving healthy, equitable and sustainable cities.

The default core set of spatial urban indicators calculated includes:

- Urban area in square kilometers
- Population density (persons per square kilometre)
- Street connectivity (intersections per square kilometer)
- Access to destinations within 500 meters:
    - a supermarket
    - a convenience store
    - a public transport stop (any; or optionally, regularly serviced)
    - a public open space (e.g. park or square; any, or larger than 1.5 hectares)
- A score for access to a range of daily living amenities
- A walkability index

# How to set up and get started?

Detailed directions to set up and perform the 3-step process to configure, conduct analysis and generate documented data, maps and reports on spatial indicators of urban design and transport features for healthy and sustainable cities are found on our website https://global-healthy-liveable-cities.github.io.

The resulting city-specific datasets of spatial indicators of urban design and transport features, calculated at a range of scales from address points, to high resolution grids of the spatial distribution, custom administrative regions and overall city summaries can be used to provide evidence to support policy makers and planners to target interventions within cities, compare performance across cities, and when measured across time can be used to monitor progress for achieving urban design goals for reducing inequities. Moreover, they provide a rich source of data for those advocating for disadvantaged and vulnerable community populations, to provide evidence for whether urban policies for where they live are serving their needs.
